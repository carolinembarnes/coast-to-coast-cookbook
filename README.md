# Coast to Coast Cookbook

This is a personal online cookbook inspired by both my West Coast childhood and East Coast life. The recipes are for sharing with friends and family, and are always evolving!

## How to use

- **Homepage (`index.html`):** Lists all recipes.
- **Recipe pages (`recipes/`):** Each recipe gets its own HTML file. Include a story/description and tags up top.
- **Tags:** Use tags like "Experiment (Not Final)", "Main Dish", "Side Dish", "Comfort Food", "Family Favorite", or anything else you like.
- **Style:** Classic, simple HTML & CSS for easy editing.

## Adding Recipes

1. Copy an existing recipe page (like `mamas-chicken-soup.html`) and edit.
2. Add your new recipe to the `<nav>` list in `index.html`.
3. Use tags to help organize recipes (suggestions: Main Dish, Side Dish, Dessert, Appetizer, Comfort Food, Experiment, Family Favorite).
4. Push changes to GitHub to update your site.
