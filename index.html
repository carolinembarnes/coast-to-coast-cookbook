                <h2>About Coast to Coast</h2>
                <p>This cookbook is a love letter to the people and places that shaped the way I cook.</p>
                
                <p>My earliest memories in the kitchen aren't with my parents—they'll be the first to admit their food choices are…interesting. But I spent hours cooking and eating with my Granny (my mom's mom, a true Southern cook) and my Papaw (my dad's dad, who made the best cherry pie). That time in the kitchen was never really about mastering techniques. It was about being together. About sharing something.</p>
                
                <p>I didn't really start experimenting until college—when I nearly set the kitchen on fire trying to make fried chicken for my then-boyfriend (now husband). I kept going, learning by trial and error. Eventually I stopped following recipes and started making my own.</p>
                
                <p>My cooking today is still rooted in family. Some of my go-to dishes now come from my father-in-law and his mom—"Mama" (pronounced meh-meh)—who bring their own lowcountry flavors to the table.</p>
                
                <p>I grew up in California and spent the first six years of my marriage in Oakland, where my cooking really took off. These days, we're back in Atlanta, closer to family on both sides.</p>
                
                <p>The name Coast to Coast is both geographic and emotional. These recipes come from both coasts and all the kitchens in between—from sweet Southern staples to bold California flavors. Each one carries a story, a memory, or a person I love.</p>
                
                <p>Thanks for being here. I hope you find something you love to share with someone at your table.</p>
