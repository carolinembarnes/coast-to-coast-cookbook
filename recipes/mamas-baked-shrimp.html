            My husband’s grandmother is a fantastic cook. She is the epitome of a Southern grandmother. For holidays, we gather at her house and help ourselves to two or sometimes even three helpings of her delicious food. She has three children and their spouses with six grandchildren with two spouses -- needless to say, it’s a full house. Before I married Ben, I fell in love with her shrimp, which the family catches themselves in South Carolina’s beautiful low country.
