        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 butternut squash (approx. 3.5 cups cubed)</li>
            <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 lb raw spicy Italian or chorizo sausage</li>
            <li>1-2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 cup baby kale</li>
            <li>1 lb pasta</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Peel, cut, and deseed the butternut squash. Cut one half into 2-inch cubes and reserve the other half for another use. Toss the squash with salt and half of the olive oil. Roast in the preheated oven on a large rimmed baking sheet for 40-45 minutes, or until tender and golden.</li>
            <li>Approximately 15 minutes before the squash is done, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to package directions.</li>
            <li>Remove the chorizo sausage from its casing and cook in a pan with the remaining olive oil, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon. When the sausage is cooked through, add the minced garlic and cook for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>When the pasta is done, drain it. Add the baby kale to the pan with the sausage, then add the pasta, grated Parmesan cheese, and chicken stock. Toss together until the pasta is well coated. Taste and add more salt if needed.</li>
            <li>Remove the roasted butternut squash from the oven and gently stir it into the pasta, trying not to break it up too much. Serve with extra Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        </ol>
