        <h2>Another Idea...</h2>
        <p>
            Remove gizzards and rinse the whole chicken inside and out. Peel and slice two onions, cutting a grid into each onion from the top but stopping short of the bottom so the onion remains whole. Slice celery (and carrots, if using) on an angle into large pieces. Peel and crush garlic cloves. Chop fresh herbs (basil, oregano, rosemary, and thyme). Prepare 2 tablespoons of salt and 1 tablespoon of pepper, season to taste.
        </p>
        <p>
            Place chicken, onion, celery, and herbs in a large pot and pour in enough water to cover the chicken. Bring to a boil and cook until chicken is tender, about one hour. Remove the chicken and set aside to cool. Remove all large pieces of vegetables and garlic—save or discard as you wish.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remove the skin and bones from the chicken. Chop or pull chicken into bite-size pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
            Place chicken pieces, rice (Carolina Gold is recommended), and dried Italian-style seasoning in the pot of chicken stock. Cook together, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cover. Cook for 20-30 minutes until the rice is tender, stirring often.
